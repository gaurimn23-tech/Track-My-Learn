# Track-My-Learn
TrackMyLearn is a website that helps students keep track of what they learn every day. It is like a helper that watches what you do and finds ways to make you better, at studying. TrackMyLearn uses computer programs to make sure you study consistently. The main goal of TrackMyLearn is to help students see how they are doing with their study activities and make good habits. TrackMyLearn is a tool that makes learning easier and more fun by using machine learning to understand how you learn.
The platform is really useful because it does a things. It helps people log what they do every day. It also has pages that show lots of information in a simple way, which is called analytics dashboards.. It uses something called predictive modeling to understand how people learn. This means the platform can look at how someone learns and give them insights about their learning behavior and what they can do to get better at the learning behavior. The platform is, about understanding learning behavior and helping people with their learning behavior.
Unlike traditional habit trackers that only record data, this system uses ML models to predict task completion likelihood and support better time management and learning performance.
- Project Objectives
